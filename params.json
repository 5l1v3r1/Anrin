{"name":"Anrin","tagline":"A Log Censore Tool","body":"#Anrin\r\nAnrin is a tool intended for IT personnel who need to export log files to external companies and other third partied. Some logs (firewalls, routers and so on) contain information such as IP addresses, MAC addresses and domain names. Usually we keep this sort of information well guarded but when exporting those logs we allow other entities to view it (along with routing information and other types of sensitive data).\r\n\r\nAnrin will be watching a folder to see new files. When a new file is added it will search for IP addresses, MAC addresses and domain named within this file. Then it will generate 'random' data to replace it. The thing about Anrin is that it will keep the basic logic behind it. \r\n\r\nFor example;\r\n\r\n    IP: 192.168.3.1 is trying to contact 192.168.3.4\r\n    IP: 192.168.3.1 is trying to contact 192.168.3.5\r\n    IP: 192.168.3.1 is trying to contact 192.168.2.3\r\n    \r\nWill be broken down into segments and will be replaced (for example) with:\r\n\r\n    IP: 143.214.34.98 is trying to contact 143.214.34.132\r\n    IP: 143.214.34.98 is trying to contact 143.214.34.15\r\n    IP: 143.214.34.98 is trying to contact 143.214.13.132\r\n    \r\nThe new file will be stored into the folder 'blacked' and will be assigned a random 6 chars name. In addition to the \"encrypted\" file there will also be a dictionary file in the same folder. This dictionary file is the \"key\" to the encrypted file. Do not transfer it to a side you do not trust. It will render the process useless and the original data open.\r\n \r\nPlease notice that this program depends on 'pyinotify' and is only a Linux library.\r\n\r\n## GPLv3\r\nAnrin - A Log file Censor Tool\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 Yuval tisf Nativ\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
